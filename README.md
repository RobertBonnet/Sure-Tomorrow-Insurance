# Sure-Tomorrow-Insurance
Insurance Project for Sure Tomorrow company using numerical methods

The insurance company Sure Tomorrow wants to solve several tasks with the help of machine learning and asks you to evaluate the possibility of this.

Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a specific customer. This will help the company’s agents with marketing.

Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a trained prediction model work better than an untrained dummy model? Can it work worse? Explain your answer.

Task 3: Predict the amount of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.

Task 4: Protect customers' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.
It is necessary to develop a data transformation algorithm that makes it difficult to recover personal information if the data falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or data obfuscation. However, the data must be protected in such a way that the quality of the machine learning models is not affected. You don’t need to choose the best model; you just need to demonstrate that the algorithm works correctly.

Project Instructions
